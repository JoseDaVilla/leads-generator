# To use the enhanced Google Maps scraper with stealth features, install these packages:
npm install puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

# Current implementation uses standard puppeteer only, but for better anti-detection 
# capabilities, you should install the packages above and update the GoogleMapsScraper.js file to use:

import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-extra';
import StealthPlugin from 'puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth';
puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());
